 Projects 1 and 2 from SNHU CS-255

# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project was developed for a fictional client offering a comprehensive online driving education service. The client needed a system that would allow users to register for an account, purchase driving packages, schedule driving sessions, take practice exams, and receive feedback. The core goal was to create an efficient and user-friendly platform that would streamline the driver education process both online and in-person.

# What did you do particularly well?
I did particularly well in breaking down the client’s needs into functional and nonfunctional requirements and translating them into clear, actionable components within both documents. I was also effective in identifying the core features that would bring the most value to the user, such as session scheduling and practice testing, and in organizing these features within the system in a scalable and maintainable way.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I were to revise one part, I would improve the initial use case diagrams by including more alternative and exception flows to better reflect real-world user behavior. I would also aim to clarify some of the relationships between components in the system architecture diagram to better demonstrate modular design and data flow.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user’s needs by carefully analyzing the client’s goals, reviewing stakeholder feedback, and creating user personas to understand different user journeys. These needs were directly implemented into the system through detailed use cases, wireframes, and structured workflows that reflect the user experience. Considering user needs is crucial to designing a product that is functional, intuitive, and valuable. A system that does not align with the user's expectations will ultimately fail, regardless of technical accuracy.

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I approach software design methodically—starting with requirement gathering, followed by use case development, process modeling, and system architecture planning. In the future, I would continue using user stories, UML diagrams, and wireframes as core strategies. I would also incorporate Agile principles to ensure the design evolves iteratively based on feedback, ensuring flexibility and alignment with user expectations.
